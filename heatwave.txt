<h2> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION </h2>
<p><font size ="4"> A heat wave, or heatwave, is a period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity, especially in oceanic climate countries.: 
While definitions vary,[2] a heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual weather in the area and relative to normal temperatures for the season.
</p>
<p>(i)   Including daytime events (extreme Tmax only) </p>
<p>(ii)  nighttime events (extreme Tmin only) </p>
<p>(iii) compound events (extreme Tmax and Tmin)</p>
<p> The term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot which may occur only once a century. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths from hyperthermia, and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning. </p>
<p> A heat wave is considered extreme weather that can be a natural disaster, and a danger because heat and sunlight may overheat the human body. Heat waves can usually be detected using forecasting instruments so that a warning call can be issued.
A heat wave occurs when the tempeature ousides exceeds 40 degree celcius.
